# About the project
The course is an introduction course to open data science for statisticians. It is a course for coding and programming to analyze and interpret data that otherwise would be just numbers and tables, with a goal in learning R and other tools to accomplish these tasks. The course consists of different excercises to be done at home or in a specific tutoring class.
