eduRatioFM = Share of female population with secondary education / Share of male population with secondary education
labRatioFM = Share of female population that participates in labour force / Share of male population that participates in labour force
YrsEduExp = Expected years of education
LifeExp = Life expectancy at birth
GNIpercapita = Gross national income (GNI) per capita (dollars, purchasing power parity)
MaternalMort = Maternal mortality rate
AdolBirth = Adolescent birth rate
RepParliament = Share of female representatives in the national parliament

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
